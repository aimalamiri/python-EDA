# Expoloratory Data Analytics(EDA) of the Unicorn Companies with Python

In this repository, I analyzed the data of the Unicorn Companies dataset using Python to explore various aspects of the data. I subsequently created a comprehensive report in PDF format to elucidate the findings for individuals lacking technical expertise.


## Exploration process in the Notebook
The notebook begins with the simple data exploration techinuques to clarify the data and how it's structured. And continues with the data cleanup to find and manage the missing values. After getting the basic stats we begin with data visualization to help us better understand the data for story telling and answer different questions from the dataset. 

Below is an enumeration of the data processing techniques I utilized:
1. Inudustrial Analysis
2. Geographic Analysis
3. Temporal Analysi
4. Investors Analysis
5. Feature Engineering
6. Bivariate Analysis
7. Multivariate Analysis
8. Expanded Correlation Matrix

## PDF report
In the PDF report, I employed the Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom (DIKW) technique, complemented by logical reasoning and visual charts from my notebook, to enhance the readerâ€™s comprehension of the process outcome and facilitate informed decision-making.

## Tech stack
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
